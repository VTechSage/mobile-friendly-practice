<h1>Hello

<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define 
paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five 
sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the 
unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
 A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that
  forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not 
  determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, 
  in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph 
  can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or 
  group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will 
  refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens 
  in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
